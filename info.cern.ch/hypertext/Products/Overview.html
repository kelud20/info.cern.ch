        >Here is a list of existing systems past present and future, which we
        have come acrosss. These include both academic research systems and
        commercially available systems. The order is random. Some Information
        retrieval systems have crept in which are not hypertext.

      Don't know much about this it may be tackling the same problem as us. Se
      <a name="14" href="Engelbart/Seminar.html">Doug's seminar</a>. A reference
      is:
      <p>
        Engelbart, Douglas. "Knowledge-Domain interoperability and an Open
        Hyperdocument System", "Proceedings of the ACM CSCW90 Conference on
        Computer Supported Cooperative Work", October 1990, pp 143--156"
      </p>
      <p>
        I have the book (Tim). Doug has an industry-based viewpoint in that
        paper. He aims at a firly complete CSCW system, but suggests starting
        with several pilot projects based on
        <a name="25" href="#24">Augment</a> . This would furnish experience
        needed for the next phase.

      <h3><a name="24">NLS/Augment, (1969!)</a></h3>
      structured documents, kept as outline, which allows zoom-in and zoom-out.
      Link anchors are full pathname and therefore can be across machines.
      <h3><a name="10" href="Xanadu/Xanadu.html">Xanadu</a></h3>
      Ted Nelson's dream since erly `60s: all the world literature in one
      publicly accessible golbal online system (analogy: you can today get a
      telephone link from anywhere to anywhere, so why not from any text to any
      other?). Every reference to a tet will lead to royalties being paid
      automatically to the author. Autodek, (the makers of AutoCAD) will produce
      a product "real soon now". Includes the use of full versioning (claimed to
      be horrifyingly comple), "hot links" (called transclusion) and zippered
      texts (eg. parallel texts like for translations or annotations.)
      <h3>NoteCards (Xerox PARC)</h3>
      Written in Interlisp D, single user, uses the card metaphor. There are two
      camps: the card sharks, who propone the idea that information comes in
      card-size chunks, and the holy scrollers, who propone that a hypertext
      node can essentially be any size and therefore has to be scrollable on the
      screen.
      <p>
        NoteCard links can be labelled with keywords for filtering. The most
        useful part of the system is its graphical browser, wherein the user can
        pick documents or edit links between them. There is one composition
        methaphor, the Filebox.
      </p>
      <h3>KMS (marketed by Knowledge sytems)</h3>
      A card system (claimed to have the Hypercard model but in 1972), wherein
      graphics and text can be mixed. The commercial version allows two card
      windows side by side (for copy-and-paste operations). It was described as
      "MacDraw with links". Its main feature is that sub-second response time is
      one of the design criteria. Scripts were first used in KMS: the traversal
      of a link can result in the executio of a piece of code of artibrary
      complexity and effet (eg. Unix shell scripts). There is no graphical
      browser. KMS is multi-user but does not warn anyone of simultaneous
      access, so during updating, if two people edit the same node, one loses...
      <h3>Hyperties (university of Maryland)</h3>
      Designed for browsing (idea that many users will look at information, only
      a few will author it), so it is asymmetric and the authoring sysgem is no
      nearly as easy to use as the browser. Sunlge user, runs on PCs with a
      research version for the Sun. Anchors are created with markup in the
      precompiled text.
      <h3>
        <a name="5" href="../Conferences/../Products/Intermedia/Intermedia.html"
          >Intermedia</a
        >
      </h3>
      A research tool developed at Brown university (van Dam (yes, Andy,) et
      al). The demo was impressive. There is a data base system parallel to the
      texts, tht holds the links. A web is a context of links, several webs can
      be created over the same set of documents. Several links can emanate from
      the same anchor. Web views can be presented, and they also give the
      history of viewing for each user. It runs under Apple's old Unix version
      for the Macintosh (and will not run on the current version). It seems to
      be dead, since there is no funding to continue the research.
      <h3><a name="8" href="Guide/Guide.html">Guide</a></h3>
      A product from <a name="13" href="Guide/OWL.html">Owl</a> , a UK company.
      Guide is based on
      <a name="11" href="../Conference/ECHT90/People.html#pbrown">
        Peter Brown's</a
      >work (U. of Kent, 1984). Runs on MS-Windows and Macintosh with a
      development version for Unix. Documents may contain text and graphics,
      struc-ture is given in application-specific files called "guidelines".
      Access to video and documents from other application possible. There is no
      web visualisation.
      <h3><a name="19">Hypercard</a></h3>
      The system for the Macintosh (Apple, 1987). Many claimed this not to be
      ahypertext system, but then the majority of real applications presented
      sed it. This is the product that made hypertext take off. It is the BASIC
      of the 1990s. It follows the card model (but has scrolling fields...)
      Incorporates graphics and text. Other media are accessible through
      extensions. Powerful scripting language. It is the only one with which I
      personally have a lot of experience. The problem with Hypercard is that
      any fancy pplication requires writing scripts, but its advantage is that
      the scrpting language allows you to do most of the things that are absent
      from othr systems.
      <h3><a name="12" href="DynaText/Overview.html">dynaText</a></h3>
      SGML-oriented, X/posix based, portable. From
      <a name="7" href="DynaText/EBT.html">EBT</a> .
      <h3>Toolbook</h3>
      Hypercard like but has an object type drawing package rather than canvas
      type, and an object oriented scripting lan- guage. From what little was
      said about it, it seems to be better than Hypercard.
      <h3>Analyst</h3>
      Runs over ParcPlace SmallTalk, available for Sun, Mac, Dos. The document
      model is of an information centre where different types of documents are
      assembled from forms, datbases, spreadsheets, maps, graphics and folders
      (which are like directories). Each document type has its own editor.
      Queries may result in virtual folders, somewhat like SQL views. Some
      support for artificial intelligence. (Who made it? -Tim)
