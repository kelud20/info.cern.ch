      <h1>W3 Server Software</h1>
      A <a name="23" href="../TheProject.html">W3</a> server, like the ftp
      <a name="19" href="..Terms.html#daemon">daemon</a> , is a program which
      responds to an incoming tcp connnection and provides a service to the
      caller. There are many varieties of W3 server software to serve different
      forms of data.
      <h2>The basic daemon</h2>
      The basic W3 daemon program serves files already in hypertext or plain
      text. This daemon then is used as a basis for many other types of server
      and gateway. Documentation includes:
      <ul>
        <li><a name="1" href="User/Guide.html">User guide</a>.</li>
        <li><a name="18" href="Basic.html">Internals</a></li>
        -- a description of the code
      </ul>
      Much of the above may also apply in whole or part to other servers
      mentioned below. Whatever server you are running, you will probably be
      interested in:

          >
        </li>
      </ul>
      <h2>Making anew server</h2>
      This daemon is often used as a basis for a more specific server for a
      given application. A server which allows a world of data to be seen as
      part of the W3 universe is known as a gateway. (Most servers could
      therefore be regarded as gateways, but the term implies some conversion or
      mapping between dissimilar worlds). For short tutorials with examples,
      see:
      <ul>
        <li><a name="15" href="JanetAndJohn.html">Writing a server in C</a></li>
        <li>
          <a name="22" href="../Provider/ShellScript.html"
            >Writing a server as a script</a
          >
        </li>
      </ul>
      It is a good idea to pick the basic daemon or one of the servers below as
      a starting point when making a new server.
      <h2><a name="20">Other servers and Gateways</a></h2>
      These are servers which provide data extracted from other systems. They
      are build using code from the basic daemon, or scripts.
